Here are some examples of patches in Max/MSP, Machine Learning, and Python. These are for educational purposes and will be updated soon with additional patches.

# Machine Learning

[UDP_Max/MSP_Python](https://github.com/raminakhavijou/ML_Max-MSP_Python.git). This patch transfers data between Max/MSP and Python for machine learning using UDP.


# Max/MSP

[Controlling Sound via Camera](https://github.com/raminakhavijou/Controlling-Sound-via-Camera.git). This patch is an interactive sound design and color system controlled by the numeric brightness data from the camera. When an object moves in front of the camera, it calculates the median brightness and sends this information to other components. This data is then used to control the speed and frequency of sound, as well as to change the background color of the projector.
